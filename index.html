    <p id="myP">The myth of the tortured genius has endured for centuries. 
            Artists as diverse as Van Gogh, Kurt Cobain and Sylvia Plath have become famous for their talent as well as for their struggles with mental health problems. 
            But a conclusive link has never been made between mental health issues and creativity.            
            For the first time reliable data has shown that the suicide rate among people working in creative roles is significantly higher than the national average.            
            The first-ever study of suicide by profession from the ONS, which covered England in the years from 2011 to 2015, showed that people who work in arts-related jobs are up to four times more likely to commit suicide.
